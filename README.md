In August 2024, I started working as a Predoctoral Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, supervised by [Dr. Siddharth Barman](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~barman/). Previously, I was an integrated BS-MS Student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, where I was advised by [Dr. Vinod Kurmi](https://vinodkkurmi.github.io/). 

I am fortunate to have been co-advised by [Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m4DyPcUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Ranjitha Prasad](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=ADJe1AsAAAAJ&hl=en) for my Master's thesis.

I am currently looking for doctoral positions in Causal Inference and the Theory of Machine Learning to tackle core problems at their intersection. I want to contribute to building robust automated decision making systems that are theoretically justified. I believe causality enforces safe and reliable decision making and that the field is ripe for meaningful and deep contributions.

I have worked in causal representation learning (CRL), causal discovery, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI),
probabilistic models, and sports analytics.
